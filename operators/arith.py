# arithmatic operators are used to perform the mathematical operations on the variables

x = 10
y = 20

print(x+y) # addition

print(x-y) # substraction

print(x*y) #multiplication

print(x/y) #division it gives complete answer of division

print(x//y) #floor division - This operator removes the decimal factor in the division

print(x%y) # modulos - This operator returns the remainder of he division

print(x ** y) # exponential
